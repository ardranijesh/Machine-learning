# Component Failure Analysis( Automotive Engineering / Manufacturing)
Everyday, we depend on many systems and machines. We use a
car to travel, a lift goes up and down, and a plane to fly.
Electricity comes through turbines and in a hospital machine
keeps us alive. These systems can fail.
Some failures are just an inconvenience, while others could
mean life or death.
Failure analysis is the process of analyzing the
component data or the component itself to determine
the reason(s) for degraded performance or
catastrophic failure of a component either, duringcomponent manufacturing and testing, during
incoming inspection, or after delivery to the customer,
at the final application.
Component failure in engineering equipment, manufactured
products or plant infrastructure not only causes damage and
affects operation, production and performance, but it can
impact your company brand and reputation.
Collecting and analyzing data is vital to deciding on remedial
action and preventing future occurrence.
When stakes are high, we perform regular maintenance on our
systems.
For example, cars are serviced once every few months and
aircrafts are serviced daily.#Brief Description dataset
"""
This dataset reflects real component failure prediction encountered in the
automobile and other industries with measurements from real equipment. The
features description: -
The six features are: -
Type: the quality of the product, consisting of a letter L, M, or H.
Meaning low, medium, and high, respectively.
Air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process.
Process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process.
Rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from power of 2860 W, overlaid with a
normally distributed noise.
Torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm
Tool wear: The quality variants H/M/L of tool wear
in the process.
Other features are:-
Target: failure or no failure (to perform binary classification).
Failure Type: type of failure (to perform multiclass classification).
Problem statement: -
Detailed EDA to conclude the reason of component failure.
Prediction w.r.to Failure and Failure Type.
